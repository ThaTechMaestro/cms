# Development: Version 1
## Overview
* First working version for the Course Management API

* Development of the Topic Resource

## Implementing the following CRUD features for the Topic resource
- Accessing all the available topics
-  Accesing a single topic
- Add a paritcular topic
- Updating a particular topic
- Deleting a particular topic

## Data Layer:
* No database was used, the topic was created as an object utilising a service class implementation.
* Each topic added as an object is stored in a list, which is created on request but only once via a service class(Singleton).

## Concepts Learned
* A fundamental understanding of RESTful APIs work and implementing different CRUD operations
